          When Iâ€™m not working full-time, Iâ€™m either working on side projects or learning something new and other little bits.
          I had my first taste of programming in college and have loved it ever since. I'm interested in all-things dev, spreadsheets,
          jokes (dad, anti, dark humor) and micro-services. I am easy-going, positive and creative. I don't have a favourite film or tv series,
          but I appreciate a good horror, thriller and psyschological piece. Admittedly, I do have a soft spot for a very typical high school and reality viewing.
